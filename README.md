# Classic-Board-Game-Simulation
Overview
This project is a C-based systems programming assignment focused on low-level programming concepts such as memory management, compilation, and command-line execution. The goal of the project was to design and implement a correct, well-structured C program that builds using a Makefile and follows systems programming conventions.
Features
Implemented core functionality in C using structured, readable code
Built and managed the project using a custom Makefile
Demonstrated understanding of compilation, linking, and execution
Practiced debugging and validating program output via terminal runs
Technologies Used
Language: C
Build Tools: Make / GCC
Environment: Unix/Linux command line
